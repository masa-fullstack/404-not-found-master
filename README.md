## Overview

![screenshot](demo.gif)

I always feel that css is more difficult than mastering the javascript framework.<br>
I decided to use bootstrap for the solution of this challenge.

The image of the scarecrow and the message display area are shown in gird.<br>
Specify "col-md-6" for each, and switch the display to 768px as the breakpoint.

Through this project, I was able to catch up on bootstrap.<br>
Thanks for taking a look:)
